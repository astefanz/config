## ASZ's key remap script.
## Original Script by Luke Smith as part of LARBS.

# This script is called on startup to remap keys.
# Decrease key repeat delay to 300ms and increase key repeat rate to 50 per second.
xset r rate 300 50
# Map the caps lock key to control, and map the menu key to right super.
setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps,altwin:menu_win
# Swap alt and super
setxkbmap -option altwin:swap_alt_win
# When caps lock is pressed only once, treat it as escape.
killall xcape 2>/dev/null ; xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape'
# Turn off caps lock if on since there is no longer a key for it.
xset -q | grep -q "Caps Lock:\s*on" && xdotool key Caps_Lock
# Touchpad
synclient TapButton1=1 # tap-to-click for left click
